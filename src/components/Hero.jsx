      question: "How does the charter process work?",
      answer: "After your initial enquiry you will be assigned a personal charter expert who will send you a selection of quotes for you to choose from. Each quote will have a clear breakdown of aircraft and airports as well as the reasons theyâ€™ve been selected for you. Should you wish to go ahead, your personal charter expert will book the private airplane and send you the flight details."
    },
    {
      question: "How do I decide which private airplane to charter?",
      answer: "Your dedicated account manager will narrow down your best options from the wide range of aircraft available. Our advice is always based on your needs and requirements."
    },
    {
      question: "How much luggage can I take with me on charter flights?",
      answer: "We will let you know how much the hold can take on your chosen aircraft and you will be able to upgrade if you feel more space is needed."
    },
    {
      question: "When do I need to check in before my charter flight?",
      answer: "When using private terminals, you are able to check in much closer to take-off than on a scheduled service flight."

      question: "Can I fly with my pet on an ACS charter?",
      answer: "Yes, although there are rules when flying into, or out of, the UK with a companion animal. They will need a pet passport as well as being microchipped, and their rabies vaccinations must be up to date."
